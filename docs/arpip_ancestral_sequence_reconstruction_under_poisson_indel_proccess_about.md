# Applied Computational Genomics team

The [Applied Computational Genomics group](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/lsfm/institutes-centres/icls/bioinformatics/) focuses on 
theoretical and computational aspects of modelling the process of genome evolution and adaptive change. With growing size 
and complexity of molecular data, we strive to keep pace providing accurate, scalable and practical computational solutions 
that enable a wide range of scientists to analyse patterns of evolution and natural selection in large genomic and omics data. 

We develop phylogenetic methods for protein-coding sequences that enable to evaluate selective pressure and detect adaptive
 instances based on genomic signatures. Our computational methods serve to generate new biological hypotheses and predictions
  for further experimental validation, with the ultimate goal to develop practical applications.

We embrace the interdisciplinary approach by integrating different data sources and combining methods from biological, 
mathematical, and computer science disciplines.
