# Applied Computational Genomics

The [Applied Computational Genomics group](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/lsfm/institute-zentren/ias/forschung/computational-genomics/) focuses on theoretical and computational aspects of modelling the process of genome evolution and adaptive change. With growing size and complexity of molecular data, we strive to keep pace providing accurate, scalable and practical computational solutions that enable a wide range of scientists to analyse patterns of evolution and natural selection in large genomic and omics data. 

We develop phylogenetic methods for protein-coding sequences that enable to evaluate selective pressure and detect adaptive instances based on genomic signatures. Our computational methods serve to generate new biological hypotheses and predictions for further experimental validation, with the ultimate goal to develop practical applications.

We embrace the interdisciplinary approach by integrating different data sources and combining methods from biological, mathematical, and computer science disciplines.

Our group is based in Switzerland and leads by [Prof. Dr. Maria Anisimova](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/anis/)


# About the developer

I received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering and also my master degree in
Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from Shiraz University, Iran in 2016. Majoring in
computer engineering from Shiraz University has improved my abilities which led me to a versatile 
and an eager-to-learn researcher. As I am greatly interested in interdisciplinary subjects,
I am a PhD student in SIB (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) and 
looking forward for extending my scientific network.
